# Quantified Self App
Web app for downloading, managing, and displaying my personal data.

---
I'm collecting a lot of different data about my life for years. Currently, it's **200+ data points** about my heart, activity, physique, diet, supplements, sleep, and mind.

I strongly believe that **data-driven life and quantified self movement** will be huge trends in the future and prerequisites to better personal health. 

My main issue with the current state is that I'm using lots of different gadgets and services, but they are operating in silos. It's hard to find a way to see all of my data in one place, see correlations, and the big picture.  At the same time, I want to have full control of how these data points are displayed and organized. And I'm not even talking about security... 

I don't have any business intentions with this project for now, but I'm open to any cooperation. **Reach me, if you're interested.** 

**Tech disclaimer**: This is one of my first big projects where I was learning lots of advanced concepts such as Flask Blueprints & Factory, caching or Oauth2 etc. It's full of spagehtti code and bad practice. I'm planning to rewrite it completely with Django and Vue.js in the near future.

### Main functionality

- Connecting to different APIs and saving data to MySQL (Withings, Oura Ring, MyFitnessPal, Apple Health)
- Displaying data through Plotly & Dash
- BE build with Flask, Pandas and SQlAlchemy. FE running on Bootstrap and Plotly Dash.
